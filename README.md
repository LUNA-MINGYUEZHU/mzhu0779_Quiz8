# Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
## Visual dislocation art
* I got some inspiration for imaging techniques from the work of Robert Gonsalves. Most of Robert Gonsalves' works present situations similar to Inception through visual dislocation. This visual effect breaks the conventional perception pattern, brings surprises with different perspective shifts and multi-level image displays, and inspires people to think, so that people have new knowledge and feelings about things. I hope to integrate these advantages into my project and innovate the interaction between project artwork and readers through visual dislocation. For example, the color change of different viewing angles is set by visual dislocation.

* This is a code effect in p5.js. The rotation coordinate system is drawn mainly by function rotate (). By changing the rotation Angle of the graph or image, it creates a dimensional change of visual dislocation. At the same time, the built-in variable 'frameCount' is set to track the number of frames drawn, which is used to control the cycle change, so as to achieve the purpose of simple measurement of time or control of animation.
